# 404 Not Found Challenge Solution

## Project Description 
This is a simple project, where the person has to design a 404 landing page. The various individual elements of the page and the figma designs have been provided by [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/). 

## Motivation
I am a beginner developer, and have just learned the various concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how a web page is put together using these three and various other frameworks. Before advancing to other technologies, I want to strengthen my foundation by practising and doing projects. And thus I started with [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/). This is my first submission.

## Basic Steps On How I Structured This
- I took the individual elements, gave them a `position: absolute` , positioned them in `viewport` units according to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/QeKWLNhB13zDjJzqR22TKE/404-page-challenge?node-id=0%3A1) design files included with the project for the desktop version.
- For the mobile version, I just turned the `position` property to `initial` to bring them back them back to the flow of the HTML document, and adjusted their respective margins accordingly.
